## Project Overview

Complete renovation and staging of Aunt Liz's house to prepare for market listing.

## Project Goals

- Renovate and refresh the property to maximize market appeal
- Complete all work within budget
- List the house in optimal condition

## Project Status
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Start Date:** November 4, 2025
**Target Listing Date:** April 20, 2026

## Optimal Listing Time
Based on real estate market analysis, the best time to list a house is in the spring, typically May or June. This period sees the highest buyer activity, leading to potentially higher sale prices and faster sales. Our target listing date of April 20, 2026, is set to capitalize on the start of this peak season.
