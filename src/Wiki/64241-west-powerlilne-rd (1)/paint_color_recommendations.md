# House Paint Color Recommendations

Based on the project's `MATERIALS.md` file and general best practices for resale, here are paint color recommendations.

### Top Recommended Interior Colors (from `MATERIALS.md`):
*   **Main Walls**: **Agreeable Gray (SW 7029)**. It's described as a top-selling, warm gray that works for the entire house.
*   **Trim & Doors**: **White Dove (BM OC-17)** or **Alabaster (SW 7008)**. These are soft, warm whites that complement the main wall color.

### Recommended Exterior Colors:
The principle of using neutral colors applies to the exterior for mass appeal.

*   **Option 1: Warm Off-White/Greige Body with White Trim**
    *   **Body Color**: Sherwin-Williams Accessible Beige (SW 7036)
    *   **Trim Color**: Sherwin-Williams Pure White (SW 7005)

*   **Option 2: Light Gray Body with White Trim**
    *   **Body Color**: Benjamin Moore Revere Pewter (HC-172)
    *   **Trim Color**: Benjamin Moore Chantilly Lace (OC-65)

*   **Recommended Accent Color (for shutters or front door)**:
    *   **Accent Color**: Sherwin-Williams Iron Ore (SW 7069) - a popular soft black.

These options are consistent with the recommendations in your project files and are proven to help sell homes. It is highly recommended to test sample swatches before committing to a color.
